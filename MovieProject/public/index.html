<h2>Orders, by Marcus Lazaro Spring 2023</h2>
 
<input type="button" value="CREATE" onclick="buttonCreate()"  />
<!--
  The purpose of the CREATE button was to confirm that the correct data is
  being created. I ended up just adding on the specified requirements for
  the SUBMIT-ONE button onto what I had for the buttonCreate() method seeing
  as there was little difference between the two besides needing using Fetch
  for SUBMIT-ONE to push up to the server.
